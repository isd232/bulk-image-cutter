This is a program to bulk-cut images and videos.


Images cropping works fine.
There might be some problems when there is a lot of videos in directory, try grouping them.

- Videos problem is actually related to size not to number of videos. Will try to fix it.


1. Choose source directory
2. Choose how much to cut from each site
3. Check preview if everything is correct
4. Click crop and directory with cropped images or videos will be created
